Why is version / source control important?
Verison Control and source control are both very important. Each version is tracked and put into history. It can be used to revert back to a previous verison. This is great for students because we can revert back to working code. Espeically when multiple people are editing the code it is a great tool. Version control allows for reversal of changes. It also tracks who made changes to what files. 

well done!
